// This file will contain all the CSS declarations we don't want to purify. Even
// if they don't match anything in the generated index.hmlt we still keep them,
// as reveal.js will add classes at runtime that will then make them match.

// We re-import variables as some of the other files depends on them
@import './_variables';

// reveal.js
@import './vendors/_reveal';

// A few overrides to add the Algolia theme in reveal
@import './_reveal-overides';
