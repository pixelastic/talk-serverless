Tech Stack: 3 servers, Bare metal, API, DSN, Nginx
Story of the offline sdk

speed is important. same servers running old offline SDK now in nginx. custom
made. optimization on latency level. Explaining DSN

started in Paris, moved to SF. opened offices in Atlanta and NYC. Will open in
London and Sydney

serverless because build apps as lego bricks. we are the searching building
block. we are experts, so you don't have to. the search problem is complex but
already partially solved. It's a specific domain of expertise, we've packaged
it.

being an API, we can bring search where it was previously not possible: static
websites. jekyll, docsearch. netlify? example of the new smashing magazine

Future?
Oflfine is back
InstantSearch everywhere
Building blocks for SSG

commong questions. search in images, in pdf, machine learning, chatbots? No, but
we want to be easy to plug with other APIs. It's a different job, and some
people are better are it. If they have an API, we'll make sure we're easy to
plug together.
